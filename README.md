# ion-dtn-docs
Bringing together ION-DTN documents into a single portable format 

The long-running NASA JPL project to create a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) router for the NASA Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) has a number of different document formats and locations. There are several PDF documents, which have evolved since 2008 or so, and a Wiki associated with the Sourceforge repository https://sourceforge.net/projects/ion-dtn/.

In building, configuring and testing ION-DTN, I kept forgetting exactly where I had read something, so I decided to crterate a single document repository with a unified look and feel. I decided to use a combination of Apache 2 and Sphinx, which can be used either as web server on the DTN node itself or as a seperate standalone web-served resource.

It is important to note I have not changed any of the documentation itself, except for editorial changes to fit in with the tools used, such as emphasising notes or converting text to sub headings where it made sense to do so.
